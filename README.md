Simple API call to destiny 2 api checking if the Destiny 2 servers are online or down for maintenance

I don't like Twitter and I would prefer to not go there to check if Destiny2 is online.

Now I can just load up this website and know exactly when the servers are up. 
It should check every minute if the servers are online via the Destiny 2 API.
